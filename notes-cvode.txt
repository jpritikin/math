Installing CVODE:
-----------------
make install-cvode


Notes for CVODE installation
------------------------------------

New scheme does not require cmake any more. This has been done in the
following way:

1. install & configure with cmake the cvode package, this creates a
sundials_config.h header file which has been dropped into the cvode
includes

2. build using cmake

3. from the two static libraries created extract with ar t the object
files which have been compiled into the static library. The output of
this command is saved into make/libsundials*.txt

4. compilation of the needed c files in the usual way

make install-cvode now uses the simpler make method

make install-cvode-cmake uses the cmake based installation (can be
configured from the user)
